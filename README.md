Implementaion milestones:
Milestone 1: Initial project setup. Gathering the required libraries that we are using for this project. Making sure
that the baseline for the project is setup. Including setting up this repository and making sure all members of the 
implementation team have access to the repsitory. 

Milestone 2: Continue implementation. We had our prototype built in adobe xd, so we started to implement the backbone of
the project which was being able to interpret speech intput using the python libraries that we are using. Once we had
that setup it enabled us to continue development on the flow of the application and how it would interact with the user.

Milestone 3: Finish implemention. We have our application completely working at this point, but only on the command line.
This is enough to start testing for usability requirements. We created our usability test plan and tweaked our implementation
based on what we saw from our usability tests

MIlestone 4: UI implementation. Our initial plan was to use Python Flask to host this applicaiton in a web browser, but 
the scope of that developement was out of the time frame we were allotted for this project. We switched gears and developed
a UI using PySimpleGui, where the app can control everyting in the gui straight from a python script. This
method was very useful and allowed us in making a clean looking UI for users to use.
